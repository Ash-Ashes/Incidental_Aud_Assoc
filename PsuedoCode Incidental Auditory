Implicit Auditory Association with Targeted Tones
Alain ERP lab with Moscovitch contributing

In person - Within study IV Fixed vs Varied tone 
            Behaviour measures
            DV  Exposure - RT tone detection time exposure | correct/incorrect accuracy
            DV test  - RT identification Old/New, Old/New accuracuy | Confidence Old/New | Confidence Accuracy
            DV Tes for Old response only - presentation side L/R accuracy | side at test match side at exposure accuracy

Goal - Reduce task time and simplify demands of exisitn paradigm while keeping difficulty
Goal - Confirm implicit association formation between tone and auditory scene
Goal - investiagte if tone as target produces recall for tone presentation side
Goal - will additional lures provide enough data for analysis of errors
Goal - begin exploration of auditory features as relating to memory performance

Conditions - within participant study
Conditions - common pure tone presentation features - all pure tones 500 Hz, 500ms duration
    Fixed Tone (FT) - onset and presentation side reamin constant for all exposure trials and test
    Varied Tone (VT) - onset time and presentation side radnomly change for each exposure trial and test
            
Codable Set Up Features
        Key responses (max 6 allowable - 4 used) - request dominant hand use for later EEG transiiton
        
        Common Keys
        Escape - end experiment -confirm not part of key count <<<<<<
        return - indicate ready to continue after instructions between exposure trials and before test - data elapsed time between end one block and start next
        shift - repeat instruction page
        
        Key Responses Exposure Phase
        Space Bar - RT task - press as fast a possible when detect tone - data RT from scene onset time
        return - data duration time between end one block and start next
        
        Key Responses - Test phase old/new (implications for later EEG)
        "<"  - Press as soon as you recognize the audio clip 
        ">"  - Press as soon as you know you do not recognize
        
        Confidence Questions - radio buttons - likert - 4 or 6 points to prevent fence sitting <<<<<confirm presentation does this
        
        Key Responses - Test phase - Tone lateralization
        "<" - Left side 
        ">" - Right side

Implicit Auditory Association with Targeted Tones
Alain ERP lab with Moscovitch contributing

Goal - Reduce task time and simplify demands of exisitn paradigm while keeping difficulty
Goal - Confirm implicit association formation between tone and auditory scene
Goal - investiagte if tone as target produces recall for tone presentation side
Goal - will additional lures provide enough data for analysis of errors
Goal - begin exploration of auditory features as relating to memory performance

Conditions - within participant study
Conditions - common tone presentation - all tones 500 Hz, 500ms duration
    Fixed Tone (FT) - onset and presentation side reamin constant for all exposure trials and test
    Varied Tone (VT) - onset time and presentation side radnomly change for each exposure trial and test

  Instructions - text - see words doc - press space bar as soon as detect tone - correct/incorrect indicator
  
  Codable Instruction Features
        Key responses - Exposure Phase
        Space Bar - RT task - press as fast a possible when detect tone
        return - indicate ready to continue between exposure trials and before test
        
    Key Responses - Test phase
        
    Practise session
  
            
            - across 4 exposures  each clip's tone retains the same onset time, frequency, and presentation side

Implicit Auditory Association with Targeted Tones
Alain ERP lab with Moscovitch contributing

In person - Within study IV Fixed vs Varied tone 
            Behaviour measures
            DV  Exposure - RT tone detection time exposure | correct/incorrect accuracy
            DV test  - RT identification Old/New, Old/New accuracuy | Confidence Old/New | Confidence Accuracy
            DV Tes for Old response only - presentation side L/R accuracy | side at test match side at exposure accuracy

Goal - Reduce task time and simplify demands of exisitn paradigm while keeping difficulty
Goal - Confirm implicit association formation between tone and auditory scene
Goal - investiagte if tone as target produces recall for tone presentation side
Goal - will additional lures provide enough data for analysis of errors
Goal - begin exploration of auditory features as relating to memory performance

Conditions - within participant study
Conditions - common pure tone presentation features - all pure tones 500 Hz, 500ms duration
    Fixed Tone (FT) - onset and presentation side reamin constant for all exposure trials and test
    Varied Tone (VT) - onset time and presentation side radnomly change for each exposure trial and test
            
Codable Set Up Features
        Key responses (max 6 allowable - 4 used) - request dominant hand use for later EEG transiiton
        
        Common Keys
        Escape - end experiment -confirm not part of key count <<<<<<
        return - indicate ready to continue after instructions between exposure trials and before test - data elapsed time between end one block and start next
        shift - repeat instruction page
        
        Key Responses Exposure Phase
        Space Bar - RT task - press as fast a possible when detect tone - data RT from scene onset time
        return - data duration time between end one block and start next
        
        Key Responses - Test phase old/new (implications for later EEG)
        "<"  - Press as soon as you recognize the audio clip 
        ">"  - Press as soon as you know you do not recognize
        
        Confidence Questions - radio buttons - likert - 4 or 6 points to prevent fence sitting <<<<<confirm presentation does this
        
        Key Responses - Test phase - Tone lateralization
        "<" - Left side 
        ">" - Right side

  Consent if not already provided (check this<<<<<)
  
  Instructions - text - (see words doc for verbage) summary - press space bar as soon as detect tone - correct/incorrect indicator colour red/green
    
Loop - instructions 
    for x pages in instruction set
        display instruction text page 
        wait for response <return> to advance screen
    return
    
    Confirmation - text - (see word doc for verbiage) - understand instruction and ready to continue press return or press shift to see instruction again
    
    if understand instruction and ready to continue press return when ready to continue
  
Practise session - 5 practice questions preset with common stimuli and preset fixed / variable 

    
 Loop - practise stimuli  
            x = 6
 
    for x (scene stimuli in practice)
        display - fixation cross - reamins until trial end
        Audio - trigger scenes + 250 ms from fixation cross onset (2500 ms duration)
        Audio -  trigger pure tone - onset time count from Audio scene initialize (or if needs from audio scene intialize add 250ms - if that no work first fiaxtion cross solo and rest trigger at end of trial)
    
    Response - Space Bar - Participant indicates detection
    Respones Data Save -> time elapse ASO to spacebar
        
        If spacebar > 100 ms Tone onset AND <
               display green correct
               data save -> correct
        Else if spacebar < tone onset time
        Else if spacebar > 2600 ms post ASO
               red incorrect
